# printf Project
## Concept
* Group Projects
* Pair Programming - How To
* Flowcharts
* Technical Writing

## Description
This team project is part of the first sprint of ALX SWE program. _printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

* How to use git in a team setting
* Applying variadic functions to a big project
* The complexities of printf
* Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

Please these are the files we will create
main.h
_printf.c
main.h
man_3_printf
print_characters.c
print_numbers.c
select_flag.c
select_print.c
write_functions.c
Create the last three of them and I will create the other three. The readme and man page will be checked before the real work will be scored. I will indicate in the main.h which file to include what.
